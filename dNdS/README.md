#Evolutionary Rate Analysis

With this project, a group of researchers provided me with a curated dataset of alignments and tasked me with running various analyses.
The project involved testing whether annual lineages of killifish were evolving at significantly different rates compared to non-annual lineages.
This was implemented via [ETE toolkit](http://etetoolkit.org/), [codeml](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html), and [iqtree](http://www.iqtree.org/).

The python functions were created in collaboration with Dr. Federico G. Hoffmann.
I created a pipeline of sorts to link all of the separate tasks together.

With a little editing and the creation of just a few list files, this pipeline can be adapted to other systems.
